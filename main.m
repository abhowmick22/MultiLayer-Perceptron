% This is the main function where we define the perceptron, read the
% inputs, train the model, predict on test, visualize the results and
% report the metrics. Each layers is fully connected to the successive
% layer.

% Define the Perceptron Neural Network


% Read the training data


% Train the matrix


% Test accuracy
